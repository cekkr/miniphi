# Recompose Samples

The `recompose` samples exercise MiniPhi's code⇄markdown benchmarking flow. Each sample folder contains:

- `code/`: canonical source files.
- `descriptions/`: markdown representations of the files (generated via `code-to-markdown`).
- `reconstructed/`: output directory for `markdown-to-code` (created on demand).
- `recompose-report.json`: optional benchmark summaries generated by the CLI.

Quick start:

```bash
node src/index.js recompose --sample samples/recompose/hello-flow --direction roundtrip --clean
```

This command wipes previous markdown/code outputs, converts each file under `code/` into markdown, rebuilds code from the markdown, compares the round-trip fidelity, and stores a step-by-step report alongside the sample.
