    "summary": "## Overview\nBelow is an outline of my approach to inspecting your workspace context and providing tailored recommendations based on the type of content you have. Since I haven’t seen explicit artifacts yet, I’ll describe how I’d proceed for both code-heavy and documentation/book-style directories.\n\n## Flow\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Initial Assessment\n\n## Signals\n• Directory Structure:  \n – For a code-heavy project, I would look for folders like “src”, “lib”, “tests” (or “test”), “docs”, “examples”, etc.  \n – For a documentation or book-style collection, I’d expect a “docs” folder with chapters organized as markdown files, perhaps an “index.md” or “README.md”, and maybe additional folders for images, styles, etc.\n\n## Edge Cases\n• File Types & Naming Conventions:  \n – In code projects, file extensions (.py, .js, .ts, etc.), clear naming conventions, and modular organization are key.  \n – For documentation, I’d check for consistent markdown formatting (headings, lists, links) along with a coherent Table of Contents.\n\n## Detail 5\n──────────────────────────────\n2. If the Workspace Is Code Heavy\n\n## Detail 6\nActionable Steps:\n• Code Organization:  \n – Verify that modules and packages are logically segmented. For example, if you have a “utils” folder or similar helper code, check that it’s separated from core business logic.  \n – Suggest refactoring opportunities—for instance, extracting duplicated code into utility functions or classes.\n\n## Detail 7\n• Testing & Quality Assurance:  \n – Look for a dedicated test suite (e.g., a “tests” directory). If tests are sparse or missing, recommend adding unit and integration tests to improve reliability.  \n – Check if there’s any linting configuration (like .eslintrc, .flake8, etc.) in place; if not, propose setting one up for consistent coding style.\n\n## Detail 8\n• Build & Deployment:  \n – Inspect build scripts or package configurations (e.g., package.json, setup.py) to ensure that dependencies are managed properly.  \n – If the project uses continuous integration (CI), review configuration files (like .github/workflows/) and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\n## Detail 9\nExample Recommendation:  \n“If your codebase currently lacks comprehensive tests, consider introducing a testing framework such as pytest for Python or Jest for JavaScript along with CI integration to automatically run tests on each commit.”\n\n## Detail 10\n──────────────────────────────\n3. If the Workspace Is Documentation/Book-Style\n\n## Detail 11\nActionable Steps:\n• Content Structure & Flow:  \n – Evaluate the Table of Contents and chapter breakdowns (e.g., Introduction, Tutorials, API Reference, Troubleshooting).  \n – Identify if there are gaps—for instance, a missing “Getting Started” or “FAQ” section—and propose new chapters to cover these topics.\n\n## Detail 12\n• Consistency & Readability:  \n – Check that markdown formatting is consistent across all documents (e.g., heading levels, bullet lists, code blocks).  \n – Suggest using a style guide or Markdown linting tool to maintain uniformity and readability.\n\n## Detail 13\n• Additional Enhancements:  \n – Recommend incorporating diagrams or interactive examples if the content benefits from visual aids.  \n – If there are outdated sections, propose updates or reordering chapters for better logical flow.\n\n## Detail 14\nExample Recommendation:  \n“If your documentation currently includes an Introduction, Features, and Usage sections but lacks troubleshooting advice, adding a dedicated ‘Troubleshooting’ chapter with common issues and resolutions could significantly enhance the user experience.”\n\n## Detail 15\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Conclusion\n\n## Detail 16\nMy overall strategy is to:\n • Thoroughly review the directory layout and file contents.\n • Identify strengths (clear organization, consistent formatting) and potential areas for improvement (lack of tests in code projects or incomplete documentation sections).\n • Provide actionable recommendations tailored to either improving code quality (through refactoring, testing, build/deployment enhancements) or enriching documentation (by restructuring content, ensuring consistency, adding missing chapters).\n\n## Detail 17\nIf you provide specific artifacts or more details about your workspace later on, I can offer even more targeted advice. This approach should help maintain a well-organized repository whether you’re working on code or preparing a comprehensive documentation set.\n\n## Detail 18\nLet me know if you’d like to focus on any particular area or need further clarification!",
