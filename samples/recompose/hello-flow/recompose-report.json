    "summary": "## Architecture Rhythm\n\nThe workspace contains approximately 9 source files organized into flows, shared helpers, and entry points. Each module collaborates via explicit imports and emphasizes deterministic behavior for recomposition.\n\n## Supporting Cast\n\nNarratives rely on greeters, math utilities, validation steps, and in-memory persistence to keep analytics repeatable. Representative files: README.md, src/flows/pipeline.js, src/flows/steps/normalize.js, src/flows/steps/validate.js, src/greeter.js, src/index.js.\n\n## Risk Notes\n\nFocus on keeping descriptions high level: no direct code blocks, only references to behaviors and data lifecycles. Use the story-driven approach to recreate functionality instead of copying syntax.",
