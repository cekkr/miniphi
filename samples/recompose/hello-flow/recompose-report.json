To get started, could you please clarify what kind of context you’d like me to work on? For example:\n\n## Flow\n• If you’re working with a book- or documentation-style collection (e.g., Markdown files forming a reference manual), let me know if you’d like an overview of its structure, suggestions for improvements, or ideas for new sections/chapters.\n\n## Signals\n• If your workspace is code-heavy (for example, a repository of source code), please tell me which parts you’re focusing on—whether it’s a code review, refactoring help, ensuring documentation consistency within the code, etc.\n\n## Edge Cases\nOnce I have more details about the specific artifact(s) or project areas you’d like to examine, I can adapt my approach accordingly. Let me know how I can assist further!",
