## Scene Setting
The sample welcomes a curious engineer into a miniature analytics lab. Instead of overwhelming the visitor with diagrams, it narrates a friendly quest: greet a collaborator, clean a handful of numbers, record what happened, and share a closing observation. Each paragraph hints that the benchmark is intentionally small but stubbornly layered so recomposition must understand intent instead of copying syntax.

## Milestones
1. A greeter voice opens and closes every run to prove that human context matters just as much as metrics.
2. A sequence of flows validates the raw numbers, rescales them, and keeps an audit trail that can be replayed.
3. A persistence note whispers that nothing leaves memory, yet snapshots are preserved long enough to compare recordings.
4. Story-driven README paragraphs coach the operator to use the `recompose` command rather than spelunking through files manually.

## Guardrails
The narrative forbids code snippets, focusing instead on what a healthy pipeline feels like: validations fail fast with descriptive reasons, logs accumulate as if a meticulous operator were jotting notes, and the CLI resets directories (`code`, `descriptions`, `reconstructed`) so each benchmark run starts from a blank slate. The emphasis on storytelling is deliberate security posture—future recomposition attempts must reason through each character’s responsibility instead of stealing tokens.

## Outcome
By the end of the README, the reader knows exactly why the “hello-flow” world exists: to stress-test MiniPhi’s ability to fall apart into prose and then reassemble into working software. The text makes recomposition achievable but not trivial by outlining expectations, hinting at nested imports, and pointing to the canonical benchmark commands without ever surfacing raw source.
