## Purpose

The file src/greeter.js operates as a javascript module with roughly 10 lines.

Exposes 2 exported symbols (greet, farewell).

## Key Elements

- Dependencies: internal-only helpers.

- Public interface: greet, farewell

- Classes: none, relies on functions.

## Flow & Edge Cases

Execution revolves around sanitizing input, coordinating helper utilities, and emitting structured results/logs. Edge cases are handled defensively (nullish names, insufficient samples, or missing state) prior to returning values.
