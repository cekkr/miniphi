## Purpose

The file src/flows/steps/normalize.js operates as a javascript module with roughly 19 lines.

It focuses on orchestration and light data shaping.

## Key Elements

- Dependencies: internal-only helpers.

- Public interface: internal utilities only.

- Classes: none, relies on functions.

## Flow & Edge Cases

Execution revolves around sanitizing input, coordinating helper utilities, and emitting structured results/logs. Edge cases are handled defensively (nullish names, insufficient samples, or missing state) prior to returning values.
