## Purpose

The file src/shared/persistence/memory-store.js operates as a javascript module with roughly 36 lines.

Defines class constructs such as MemoryStore.

## Key Elements

- Dependencies: internal-only helpers.

- Public interface: internal utilities only.

- Classes: MemoryStore

## Flow & Edge Cases

Execution revolves around sanitizing input, coordinating helper utilities, and emitting structured results/logs. Edge cases are handled defensively (nullish names, insufficient samples, or missing state) prior to returning values.
