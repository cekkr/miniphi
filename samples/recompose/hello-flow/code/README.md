# Hello Flow Sample

This intentionally small project keeps the `recompose` benchmark deterministic. The code exports a pair of helper modules:

- `src/greeter.js` handles friendly greetings/farewells.
- `src/math.js` performs average/trend calculations.
- `src/index.js` ties the helpers together and prints a short CLI summary.

Use `node src/index.js recompose --sample samples/recompose/hello-flow` to convert these files into markdown and back.
