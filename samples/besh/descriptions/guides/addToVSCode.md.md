# File Purpose
This file configures Visual Studio Code to recognize .bsh files as shell scripts, ensuring proper syntax highlighting and language support.

## Configuration Details
The settings.json file maps the .bsh extension to the shellscript language mode. This ensures that VSCode treats .bsh files with the same syntax rules as standard shell scripts.

## Impact
- Enables syntax highlighting for .bsh files in VSCode.
- Facilitates better code readability and editing experience.
- No runtime or functional changes to the shell itself.
