# Purpose
The .gitignore file filters out generated artifacts and build byproducts to keep the repository clean. It prevents accidental commits of intermediate files like object code, libraries, executables, and debug symbols.

## Scope
It covers C compilation outputs (object files, libraries), linker artifacts (maps, exports), precompiled headers, shared objects (SO/DLL), executables across platforms, and kernel module side effects. It also excludes common IDE/editor metadata (.DS_Store).

## Edge Cases
Duplicate entries for .DS_Store are harmless but redundant; the file still functions correctly. Missing patterns would require manual cleanup if those artifacts were ever committed.

## Flow
When cloning or pulling, Git uses this file to skip checking out ignored files. During development, it ensures only source and configuration files remain in the working tree.
