# Narrative

## Overview
The document critiques a design choice where the third parameter is frequently used as the result parameter, questioning its rationale.

## Critique
The author expresses frustration over this pattern, labeling it 'absurd' without further elaboration. This suggests a strong disagreement with the design but lacks detailed reasoning or examples to support the claim.

## Impact
The lack of context makes it difficult to assess whether this is a legitimate issue or a matter of personal preference. The document may need additional information to be actionable.
