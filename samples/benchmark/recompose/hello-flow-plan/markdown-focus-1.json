    "summary": "## Overview\nHi there! I noticed you mentioned “provided workspace context” but at the moment no specific file structure, codebase, or documentation hub has been shared in this conversation. Could you please clarify what kind of project or artifact you’re working on? For example:\n\n## Flow\n• Is it a code-heavy repository (with source files, tests, etc.)?\n• Or is it a documentation set or book-style markdown collection (with chapters, sections, etc.)?\n\n## Signals\nOnce I have more details about the structure and your goals for this workspace, I can offer targeted suggestions. Here are some general ideas to get you started:\n\n## Edge Cases\n1. For a code-heavy project:\n – Organize your files into clear directories (for example, placing source code in a “src” folder, tests in a “tests” folder, and documentation in a “docs” directory).\n – Include a README file that explains how to set up, build, and run the project.\n – Consider adopting coding standards and adding automated tests or linters.\n\n## Detail 5\n2. For a book-style markdown collection or documentation hub:\n – Create an index or table of contents (e.g., “index.md”) that links to various chapters or sections.\n – Use consistent formatting throughout your markdown files (consider using front matter for metadata, standardized headings, etc.).\n – Propose new chapters if needed—such as “Introduction,” “Background,” “Getting Started,” and so on—to ensure a cohesive narrative.\n\n## Detail 6\nIf you could provide more context or specify which area you’d like help with, I’ll be happy to dive deeper into the details and propose actionable improvements!",
