However, I don’t see any specific details—such as file names, directory structures, or key code modules—in your message. Could you please clarify which parts of the workspace should be examined? For example:\n\n## Flow\n• If it’s a book- or documentation-style Markdown collection, let me know which chapters or sections you’re most interested in reviewing so I can provide a cohesive overview and suggest edits or new content.\n\n## Signals\n• If it’s a code-heavy repository, could you specify which directories or modules to focus on? That way I can offer detailed engineering insights and actionable recommendations for improvement.\n\n## Edge Cases\nProviding this extra context will help me tailor my analysis and suggestions exactly to your needs. Please let me know how you’d like to proceed!",
