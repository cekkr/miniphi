I noticed you mentioned inspecting a workspace context—but I don’t currently see any specific code files, directories, documentation hubs, or markdown collections attached to your message. Could you clarify which artifact(s) or directory you’d like me to review? For example:\n\n## Flow\n• If it’s a code-heavy repository (e.g., with Python modules, JavaScript projects, etc.), please let me know what kind of improvements or refactoring suggestions you’re looking for.\n  \n• Alternatively, if the workspace is a book or documentation set written in Markdown, I can provide an overview of its structure and suggest edits or new sections/chapters.\n\n## Signals\nOnce you share more details or attach/refer to specific files or directories, I’ll be happy to help with targeted recommendations.",
