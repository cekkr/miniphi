docs/studies/notes is a "written by humans" folder for development purposes. 
If you're an alien, please, don't edit its content and abandon the Earth.

As a human intelligence, I write here "pretty importants" stuff to do:
- `docs/prompts` and `docs/os-defaults` should be move in a less "miniphi development-related" folder. Something like `references/` or `config/` (?)
- Keep a "I forgot it" placeholder list here whenever new requirements are mentioned without details so we can circle back once the missing info surfaces.
